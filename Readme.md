## Project Overview üöÄ
    Our project is of creating an online all-in-one platform which bridges the gap between us and our heritage. Our vision is to build a centralized platform, available to all, which satisfies all the heritage needs including preservation and community. 

## Tech Stack üíª
Here are the technologies and tools we used to build our AI solution:

    1. Website building using Google sites
    2. Payment Gateways for Crowdfunding and Ticket Booking
    3. Google maps integration on website and future application

## Project Features and Functionality ‚ú®
Problems:
    1. Lack of a centralized platform : There is no all-in-one platform which facilitate us in connecting with our rich heritage.
    2. Lack of funding : There is a shortage of funds for preservation and maintenance of our monuments, artifacts, etc.
    3. Lack of community : There is no social platform for heritage enthusiasts to connect and interact with each other.
    4. Lack of awareness : Our heritage is so rich that there are many less known brilliant heritage sites which are yet to come into   spotlight.

Our Project / Solution:
    1. Our platform revolutionizes heritage exploration by seamlessly connecting users to endless historical sites through online ticket booking, navigation and various other facilities for ease of travel.
    2. We empower heritage enthusiasts to join the noble cause of preserving our heritage using integrated crowdfunding features.
    3. We also aim to facilitate heritage explorers in interacting with each other by connecting them through our platform and build a strong community. Our platform will enable users to create their own profiles, create forums, share images/videos, etc.
    4. Various cultural events happening pan india will be listed on our platform for facilitating more public interactions.
    5. We plan to create a mobile app for easier access to our provided facilities including "near you" search option.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
We link the users with heritage by providing a platform where various services are offered. Such as ticket booking, navigation, crowdfunding and we plan to expand by providing taxi services, personal profiling, community building, cultural activities listing, application with "near-you" search and many more.

## Future Enhancements üöß
Currently we have developed / are developing :
    1. website building 
    2. Online ticket booking and navigation
    3. Crowdfunding features

Future plans / ideas :
    1. Adding many other facilities like taxi services and more which are suitable/appropriate.
    2. Creating an app for the same facilities and creating a "near you" search option.
    3. Building an online community by providing features like personal profile building, forum section, media section, etc.
    4. Having multilingual support on website and application.
    5. Our vision is to boost our heritage tourism and build an online community of heritage explorers while helping in the preservation of our heritage.
